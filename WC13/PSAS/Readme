Currently, you can find the following files here:

   build.bash          bash shell script to compile application
   build.sh            csh Unix script to compile application
   job_psas.sh         job configuration script
   ocean_wc13.in       ROMS standard input script for WC13
   s4dvar.in           4D-Var standard input script template
   wc13.h              WC13 header with CPP options

To run this application you need to take the following steps:

  (1) Customize your preferred "build" script and provide the
      appropriate values for:

      * Root directory, MY_ROOT_DIR
      * ROMS source code, MY_ROMS_SRC
      * Fortran compiler, FORT
      * MPI flags, USE_MPI and USE_MPIF90
      * Path of MPI, NetCDF, and ARPACK libraries according to
        the compiler. Notice that you need to provide the
        correct places of these libraries for your computer.
        If you want to ignore this section, comment out the
        assignment for the variable USE_MY_LIBS.

  (2) Notice that the most important CPP options for this application
      are specified in the "build" script instead of "wc13.h":

      setenv MY_CPP_FLAGS "-DW4DPSAS"
      setenv MY_CPP_FLAGS "${MY_CPP_FLAGS} -DPOSTERIOR_EOFS"
      setenv MY_CPP_FLAGS "${MY_CPP_FLAGS} -DPOSTERIOR_ERROR_I"

      this is to allow flexibility with different CPP options.

      For this to work, however, any "#undef" directives MUST be
      avoided in the header file "wc13.h" since it has precedence
      during C-preprocessing.

  (3) You MUST use the "build" script to compile.

  (4) Customize the ROMS input script "ocean_wc13.in" and specify
      the appropriate values for the distributed-memory partition.
      It is set by default to:

      NtileI == 2                               ! I-direction partition
      NtileJ == 2                               ! J-direction partition

      Notice that the adjoint-based algorithms can only be run
      in parallel using MPI.  This is because of the way that the
      adjoint model is constructed.

  (5) Customize the configuration script "job_psas.sh" and provide
      the appropriate place for the "substitute" Perl script:

      set SUBSTITUTE=${ROMS_ROOT}/ROMS/Bin/substitute

      This script is distributed with ROMS and it is found in the
      ROMS/Bin sub-directory. Alternatively, you can define
      ROMS_ROOT environmental variable in your .cshrc login
      script. For example, I have:

      setenv ROMS_ROOT /home/arango/ocean/toms/repository/trunk

  (6) Execute the configuration "job_psas.sh" BEFORE running
      the model. It copies the required files and creates "psas.in"
      input script from template "s4dvar.in". This has to be done
      EVERY TIME that you run this application. We need a clean and
      fresh copy of the initial conditions and observation files
      since they are modified by ROMS during execution.

  (7) Run ROMS with data assimilation:

      mpirun -np 4 oceanM ocean_wc13.in > & log &
