You must perform the following calculations in the order shown below:

(1) Run forecast FCSTAT - the forecast initialized from the RBL4DVAR-RPCG analysis
    of Exercise 3. Ensure that your RB4DVAR-RPCG output files are saved in the
    sub-directory called RBL4DVAR/EX3_RPCG. FCSTAT will run the non-linear model
    using BULK_FLUXES. The computed fluxes will be used in steps (2) and (3).

(2) Run forecast FCSTA - the forecast initialized from the RBL4DVAR-RPCG analysis
    of Exercise 3, but with BULK_FLUXES undefined, and using the surface fluxes
    saved in step (1).

(3) Run forecast FCSTB - the forecast initialized from the background solution used
    in the RBL4DVAR-RPCG analysis of Exercise 2. Ensure that your RBL4DVAR-RPCG output
    files are saved in the sub-directory called RBL4DVAR/EX3_RPCG. FCSTB will run
    the nonlinear model with BULK_FLUXES undefined and use the surface fluxes saved
    in step (1).

(4) Create the impact forcing files for the adjoint model:

    (a) Using the verifying analysis as a surrogate for the true state -
        Go to the directory ../Data and run the script adsen_37N_transport_fcst.m
        This will create two netcdf files called wc13_foi_A.nc and wc13_foi_B.nc.

    (b) Using new observations as a surrogate for the true state -
        Go to the directory ../Data and run the script adsen_SST_fcst.m
        This will overwrite two existing netcdf files called wc13_oifA.nc and
        wc13_oifB.nc.

(5) Run the forecast observation impact driver for the two cases in (4).
